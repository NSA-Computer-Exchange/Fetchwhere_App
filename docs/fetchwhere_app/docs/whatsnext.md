The idea behind making this bit of code public is to provide an example of how to make FetchWhere API calls using Python.

It's by no means a complete solution. There's no error checking and you will receive exceptions if things like directory permissions are too tight
or if you have no network connectivity or even if the config.ini file entries are not correct.

__** Use at your own risk **__

You are free to modify the python source to suit your own needs, use in your projects or scripts etc.

The __Fetch.exe__ was compiled using [__PyInstaller__](https://pyinstaller.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html)  
If you'd like to compile your own updates or changes to the program you can install __PyInstaller__ using pip:

    pip install pyinstaller
